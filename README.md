# Metrics Webapp - Jose Abel Ramirez Frontany

React Capstone where I have to build about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) making use of React and Redux. I selected an API that provides numeric data about a topic that I like and then build the webapp around it. I choose the API of "CoinGecko API V3".

The webapp have 2 pages:

- The first page with a list of items that could be filtered by some parameters; in my implementation, it's a list of cryptocurrencies that can be filtered by the name of the cryptocurrency. This page is my homepage.

- The second page for the item details; in my implementation, the detail page routes to the details of a particular cryptocurrency once is clicked.
